===============================

Welcome to my version of the “frogger game”! 

Directions to play:
1. Open the index.html file in your favorite browser (preferably google chrome)
2. You will see a game canvas, that contains a grassy area, a path and some water, and you - the heroine, will be standing in the middle of the grass ready to make your move.
3. Use the arrow keys to get yourself across the path to touch the water, but the tricky part is that there will be many ugly bugs as big as you are trying to knock you back in place. If you touch them, you will have to start from the beginning.
4. Good luck and have fun!

The making of this game:
The goal of this was to make my own version of the frogger game using the game engine and graphics provided by Udacity. The main body of work was done in the file called app.js, where I created pseudo classes for Enemy and Player, instantiated them, and implemented collision detection. One small change was created in the engine.js file to be able to choose a new player sprite image. I didn’t unfortunately have time to make this game more interesting..
